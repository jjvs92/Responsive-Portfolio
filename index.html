                <p class= "p">Hello, I am Julian Villarreal. I am 25 years old soon to be 26 in May. I am from a small border town called Eagle Pass. I moved to Austin January 2016 and it was the best decision I've ever made. My favorite thing about living in a big city is there is always something new to do.<p>

                <br> <br>
                
                <p class= "p">I joined The Coding Boot-camp at UT Austin with the hope that after six long tough months I will leave with the skills that will help me start a new carrer and set myself up for a better future.</p>

                <br> <br>
                
                <p class="p">I am very excited for the future as it has only been one week fo class and I am already creating this on my own.</p>
